    <p class="description_content">
      I’ve been interested in UX and UI design. I took the Udacity Product Design course and this was it’s outcome.
      The course covers, product ideation and validation, UI/UX design, design sprints and identifying key metrics.
      Students can choose to ideate their own unique product or complete the course with one of their examples.
      I created a unique app that enables a user to design their own pin-back buttons.

    <h3 class="description_title">Ideation and validation</h3>
    <p class="description_content">
      An original idea is hard to come by. The course suggests some ideas to complete the project. I was making some pin
      back buttons for a non-profit I volunteer and was considering going that route. Then I realized that pin-back buttons
      are something that most everyone likes! My next thought was: Is there a convenient way for anyone to design and make
      a button. Of course there is. – Web based services like Zazzle. I thought the idea was dead, until I did further research
      and realized that all option were desktop web based. So now the challenge is to create an application that can be accessed
      on a mobile device so users can create buttons on a whim. A key component of the design is to build-in restrictions to allow
      the user to create a beautiful design without letting them feel limited by the process.

    <p class="description_content">
      During the course I made an effort to make this as close to a actual project request as possible by creating a project
      requirements chart. Within this chart I identified the needs of the business and the needs of the user. I created flow
      charts identifying happy paths and fringe cases. User personas were created to identify the various types of users for
      this app. The users range from complete novices to super users.

    <h3 class="description_title">Design Sprints</h3>
    <p class="description_content">
      Low fidelity prototypes were designed early on to test assumptions. This helped immensely to quickly sketch UI
      elements and to test user flows. As the project progressed, high fidelity protypes where created to administer
      more user tests. Many designs were reiterated based on these tests. I am fortunate to have access to UX designers
      that agreed to meet with me and critique my designs. Together with their feedback and the user tests I was able
      to create an experience I feel confident is intuitive.

          A simple color pallet comprised of black, grey and white tones is utilized in the design canvas of this app. This
          allows for an uninterrupted work space for the user. The hot pink/ purple, I affectionally named “Beat” is the brand
          color. This color embodies the energy and appeal of pin-back buttons. The shapes throughout the experience give a nod
          to shape of the buttons themselves. This roundness carries on the buttons as well. The whole UI underwent many iterations
          based on user tests.
